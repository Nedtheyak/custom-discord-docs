# Creating Roles And Permissions For A Server
{: .no_toc }

When in a server community, it is be hard to manage a large amount of users. Server owners and admins probably don't want to allow new members to have the exact same powers as them. Having unchecked powers could make the server subject to griefing and overall damage the community. To circumvent this, Discord has many customizable options to restrict or give access to powers through assigning users roles, giving special permissions and restricting category/channel access.

This section of the documentation will show you how to create roles, what options you can enable/disable, how you can assign roles to users and changing permissions for categories and channels.

## Roles

In a server, roles are often seen as one of the most important tools to enforce server rules and management. It is important to set them up before opening up your server to other users.  

### Navigating The Roles Menu

1. **Open up Discord and navigate to a server that you have administrative powers in, or create a new server.**

    The roles options are within the server settings option, you can access it by clicking the small downwards arrow next to the server name.

2. **Go into the Roles menu by clicking the option in the sidebar.**

Once you've entered the Roles menu, you will see all the information concerning the current roles for the server. Take a moment and look through each of the permissions you can grant. 

Each section in this menu will be explained below.

**Current Roles**
