# Searching And Pinning Messages
{: .no_toc }

In Discord, it is possible to search for and pin any prior messages sent. Discord keeps a log of all messages you and others have sent, and it is accessible at any moment if you're within channel or conversation that it was sent.

The purpose of this section is show you how to both search for specific messages, as well as pin them for easy access in the channel or conversation.

## Searching for a Specific Message

Let's assume we are searching for an image sent by another user.

1. Open up Discord and select a server or direct message conversation.

2. Navigate to the search bar at the top right of the application and click it.

    You will see an abundant amount of options to choose from. To find an image, we will use the **has:** option.

    Once we've selected our option, we can further filter our selection by selecting what the message must contain. Here, we pick that the message must contain an image.

    After picking these two filtering options, any messages that meet the requirements will be displayed on a sidebar on the right side of the application.

    You can now scroll through any past messages to find the message you're looking for. Clicking any images, videos or GIFs in the side bar will enlarge them in the application so you can view them easier.

    If you find the message, you can immediately jump to it by hovering your mouse over the top right corner and pressing the jump icon that shows up.
