## My bot isn't responding/working as expected!

If your bot is not responding as expected, here are some tips for reasonable measures.
    
1. **Give the bot some time to respond.**

    Be patient. Give it a minute, then try your command again.

    If the bot is offline, give it 5-10 minutes to come back online. 

2. **Check your syntax (prefix, command name).**

    It may sound silly, but check for typos in your message. Make sure you're using the right prefix. Maybe even try a different command that you used earlier, which you know should work.

3. **Check their website.**

    Check the bot's website for information about potential downtime or recent changes, if available.

4. **Check their Discord server.**

    Look in the support server for the bot. See if there is anyone asking about the same problem, or if there are any recent messages from staff regarding this issue.

Your issue may be timely, but mentioning them will likely only annoy them. Follow their rules carefully, and you are much more likely to be helped.

5. **Ask for help from staff.**

    Humbly ask for help in their Discord server (or any other platform, if available). Ideally you will get an accurate response from a staff member, but often the community can help, as well. Be open to hearing advice from anyone.

6. **Investigate other options.**

    If you still can't get the bot to work, search for alternatives. Many bots serve the same purpose, so if possible, search websites like [top.gg](https://top.gg/), or simply through your search engine. 
    
    Sometimes users your original bot's Discord server will have suggestions about alternatives too, but be wary of angering their community members. Many staff members or community members might be quite partial to this bot, and asking for alternatives within their server can be quite disrespecful. When in doubt, just do your own research.


## The message I searched for/pinned message isn't showing up!

1. **Wait for a response.**

    It is possible that Discord's API might not be working at the time you attempt to search for or pin a message, wait a little and periodically check the [Discord Status](https://status.discordapp.com/) site just in case there is a problem with retrieving messages.

    It may be possible that your connection is not the strongest too, if so, relocate somewhere else and try again.

2. **Check if you're in the right server/conversation.**

    Yeah I know, it may sound silly but you could be checking the wrong server/conversation for the message. Try checking conversations you think you sent the message in, as well as double-check the ones you've already searched through.

3. **Make your search parameters more specific.**

    Searching for messages as specifically as possible really helps out Discord's searching algorithm. Make sure you're specifying who sent the message, when it was sent or the channel it was sent under, and if there were any links or files sent in the message.

## My channel/category restrictions aren't being enforced!

1. **Check that you assigned the restrictions to right categories/channels**

    You may have assigned the restrictions to the incorrect category/channel, or you may have enabled/disabled the wrong permissions.

2. **Check that you assigned the restrictions are role relative**

    If you're disabling permissions on a role-by-role basis, then you may have not assigned the correct permissions to the correct role. Check and see if you added the correct roles by clicking the *`+`* right next to the **Roles/Members** identifier in the *`Edit Channel`* option. Check if you've also applied the correct restrictions as well.
