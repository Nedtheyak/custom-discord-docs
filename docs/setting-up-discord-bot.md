# Setting Up A Discord Bot On A Server
{: .no_toc }

Bots are great as a regular point of discussion, or a means of moderating your server. They can help keep your server under control, and can have fun activities. In this guide, we will show you how to add a bot to your server and get it set up.

We will start with general instructions for getting a bot on your server, and then walk you through setting up some popular bots.

## Inviting a Bot

1. **Select a bot to add.**

    You'll need to choose a bot to match your purposes. Bot list websites like [top.gg](https://top.gg/) can help you find one easily. For the sake of this guide, we'll be using the multi-purpose bot [UnbelievaBoat](https://unbelievaboat.com/).

2. **Find the bot's invite link.**

    You'll need to find and click the link to invite the bot to the server. If your bot is from [top.gg](https://top.gg/), the bot's page will have a clearly marked "Invite" button:

    If you are looking at a custom website for a bot, look for and click a button or link labelled "Invite to Discord," "Add to Server," or similar phrases. Here's an example:

3. **Select your target server.**

    You should be brought to a page a panel like this. Select your desired server from the dropdown menu, and click "Continue."

<script>
function toggleSpoilers(tagId) {
    let targetSpoiler = document.getElementById(tagId);
    if (targetSpoiler.style.display == 'none') {
        targetSpoiler.style.display = 'default';
    } else if (targetSpoiler.style.display == 'default') {
        targetSpoiler.style.display = 'none';
    }
}
</script>

<button onclick="toggleSpoilers('test')">Show/Hide Images</button>
<span id='test' style='display: none'>hi</span>

## Setting up MEE6 (optional)



## Setting up Dyno (optional)



## Setting up UnbelievaBoat (optional)



You should now be ready to use your bot! If the bot stops responding, give it some time to come back online, then contact the developers if it remains offline.
