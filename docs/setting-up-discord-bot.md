# Setting Up A Discord Bot On A Server
{: .no_toc }

Bots are great as a regular point of discussion, or a means of moderating your server. They can help keep your server under control, and can have fun activities. In this guide, we will show you how to add a bot to your server.

1. Select a bot to add. 

    You'll need to choose a bot to match your purposes. Bot list websites like [top.gg](https://top.gg/) can help you find one easily. For the sake of this guide, we'll be using the multi-purpose bot [UnbelievaBoat](https://unbelievaboat.com/).

2. Find the bot's invite link.

    You'll need to find the link to invite the bot to the server. If your bot is from [top.gg](https://top.gg/), the page will have a clearly marked "Invite" button:

    <img src="https://kaydens.ca/user-docs-discord/assets/images/topgg_invite_button.png" alt="Bot invite button on the website top.gg" style="height: 220px" />

    If you are looking at a custom website for a bot, look for a button or link labelled "Invite to Discord," "Add to Server," or similar phrases. Here's an example:

    <img src="https://kaydens.ca/user-docs-discord/assets/images/invite_to_discord_button.png" alt="Example of a button to invite a bot. Text: Invite to Discord" style="height: 50px" />


You should now be ready to use your bot! If the bot stops responding, give it some time to come back online, then contact the developers if it remains offline.
