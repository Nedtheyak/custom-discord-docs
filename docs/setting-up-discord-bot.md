# Setting Up A Discord Bot On A Server
{: .no_toc }

When you're first setting up your Discord server, you may want to add something interesting to do when not conversing with other members. You may also be looking for a regular point of discussion, or a means of moderating and keeping your server under your control. Bots are a great way to do this, and in this guide we will show you how to add one.

1. Select a bot to add. 

    You'll need to choose a bot to match your purposes. Bot list websites like [top.gg](https://top.gg/) can help you find one easily. For the sake of this guide, we'll be using the multi-purpose bot [UnbelievaBoat](https://unbelievaboat.com/).

2. 


You should now be ready to use your bot! If the bot stops responding, give it some time to come back online, then contact the developers if it remains offline.
