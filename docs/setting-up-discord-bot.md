{: .no_toc }

Bots are great as a regular point of discussion, or a means of moderating your server. They can help keep your server under control, and can have fun activities. In this guide, we will show you how to add a bot to your server.

1. Select a bot to add. 

    You'll need to choose a bot to match your purposes. Bot list websites like [top.gg](https://top.gg/) can help you find one easily. For the sake of this guide, we'll be using the multi-purpose bot [UnbelievaBoat](https://unbelievaboat.com/).

2. 


You should now be ready to use your bot! If the bot stops responding, give it some time to come back online, then contact the developers if it remains offline.
