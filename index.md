## Why Use Discord?

Discord was created in 2015 as a alternative for older VOIP (Voice over IP) services like Skype and Teamspeak. Discord's main market was to create a much stronger communication platform for online communities, specifically targeted towards gaming. Over 5 years later, Discord has amassed over 250 million users and is a cornerstone for building online communities.

Discord is a communication powerhouse, and for many communities, it is the main way for them to share and collaborate. If you ever plan to manage communities digitally, especially in the gaming or entertainment space, Discord is a great way to connect with people and build that community.
