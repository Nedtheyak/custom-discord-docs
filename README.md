## Overview of The (Unofficial) Discord User Documentation

Hello readers! This is a collection of documentation for the VOIP application Discord. The main focus of this documentation was to curate some useful tips and tricks a Discord user could learn to enrich their experience using the application.

Our documentation will inform and teach you how to:

- Invite and set-up a Discord Bot to a server
- Create and manage roles on a Discord server
- Search and pin message in a text channel or direct message conversation
- Understand some of Discord's common terminology
- Help users to troubleshoot some of the common problems they may have

## Our Collaboration

This project was assigned to us after BCIT transitioned to online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as such, all of our interactions were done online. Our main communication tool was through Discord, with occasionally using Slack and Zoom for discussion with our instructor.

We begun by choosing our topic, Discord and thinking of some ideas of topics we could do for it. We were both longtime Discord users so we decided to topics that a user that had been using Discord for a fair bit of time would find useful.

We were in regular contact with one another, and we would update each other when we finished large sections of work. Making sure that our design was cohesive and consistent was a point we heavily focused on. We also ensured the quality of our work was not hampered when doing this.

## Documentation Creation

We were prompted to use markdown to create our documentation. As Discord has in-built markdown for messaging, we were already familiar with it coming into developing our documentation. Markdown makes displaying specialized text like highlights or code blocks simple to implement.

The main parts of markdown we learned were linking web pages and images, tables and lists, ordering on the navigation bar and proper formatting.

### VS Code

We were introduced to VS Code during the web development course during term 1 in CST. VS Code is Microsoft's proprietary code editing software. Since it is so adaptable to many languages, it made it the natural option for writing our documentation in.

VS Code also has a real time preview menu for markdown files, making it easy for you to see how your changes would affect the displayed information.


### Writing Easily Digestible Documentation

We employed common tactics seen in other publically available documentation, this would ensure that our documentation is easy-to-read, easy-to-follow and be user friendly first and foremost.

We would combine information that is closely relevant to each other into their own sections. This makes it easier for the user to search for the specific piece of information they are looking for, alongside giving them a cohesive understanding of the concept that is being expressed in that section. 

We used a typography standard to make it easier for the user to understand special commands and prompts in our documentation. It was important to differentiate those commands from the other information presented around it.

Our use of images was vital in helping the user better understand what exactly they would be seeing and doing on the actual application. Visual aid can help a new user not get lost in the instructions.

We used this symbol for notes, 

<img src="https://kaydens.ca/user-docs-discord/assets/images/note.png" alt="Note." style="height: 50px"/>

and this symbol for warnings,

<img src="https://kaydens.ca/user-docs-discord/assets/images/warning.png" alt="Caution." style="height: 50px"/>

This was done to better emphasize important sections of information that the user reading should pay attention to.


## Conclusion

Completing this guide was certainly an informative experience in both writing and teamwork. Many companies with open APIs must write this documentation themselves, and it is vital that it is as easily understandable as possible. It was certainly good practice in how to write efficient and effective technical documentation, something that we may have to do in the future.

Working in teams may prove difficult at times but, if you both share a cohesive vision, then your work together will be a sum greater than the abilities of each individual working on it. We strengthened our interpersonal skills and relationships through this project, and I'm pretty sure the both of us would enjoy working on a project together again.

Thank you for reading this documentation on Discord, we hope you will be able to us this information to enrich your time on Discord.
